# Matrix Deployments

## Overview

Matrix deployments allow you to deploy to multiple environments or configurations in parallel. This can be useful for testing or deploying to different cloud providers or regions.

## Example Workflow

```yaml
name: Deploy

on: [push]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        region: [us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-central-1]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy to ${{ matrix.region }}
        run: echo "Deploying to region ${{ matrix.region }}"
```
